### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Difference between event.target and event.currentTarget - by Minami
While I was working on Javascript function to like and unlike individual photo, grabbing the ID of the each post from the ID of the clicked element was not always successfull and post_id remained undefined. This was due to the [event bubbling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling) - event bubbles up from the innermost element that was clicked to its parents. 

To explicitly get the ID of that the event listener is attached to, switching from event.target to event.currentTarget solved this problem.

#### 2. Database Creation
This project gave us the opportunity to create a database from scratch. Creating the schema, models, seed data, and model associations was an extremely valuable experience. It was very helpful to see how good database design is an integral part of a full stack web application. Below you can see an overview of our database design with the table associations.
